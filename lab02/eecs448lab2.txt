I don't know how impressive this is, but I had fun making it. I was also reacquainting my self with java, as it has been a while. 

My program is a number guessing game. It generates a three character long
number and then ensures that the number has no repeating characters. 
It gives hints to the user based on the guesses that the user inputs. It then 
tallies all the guesses the user used and gives the user a number of points earned, 
based on the number of guesses the user had left. 

The program is in java. I used eclipse to write and compile it.
